Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been hailed as a bold direction in the future of fintech, bringing 
with it the promise of democratized access to capital. The appeal of DeFi lies in its potential to 
rethink current financial paradigms and introduce new ones. The focus of this paper is on the 
elements that set DeFi apart from traditional elements of banking and finance. While there are 
many such elements, we sought to uncover the constructs that have little to no semblance with 
traditional financial processes. Specifically, we focused on automated market makers, consensus 
algorithms powering the blockchains, and flash loans that stand in stark contrast to order books, 
centralized governance, and collateral-based lending, respectively. This paper provides an 
overview of these unique DeFi primitives that have little in common with the world before 
blockchain, and present implications for responsible innovation in blockchain-powered fintech 
applications.
