Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs) are a critical component of economic 
development and growth. The accumulation and effective utilization of knowledge 
capabilities allow firms to create value and improve competitiveness. However, 
recent technological advances in KMSs have outpaced research in this area, which 
continues to be siloed and characterized by a lack of cohesive frameworks and a 
limited focus on cognitive learning. This paper provides a conceptual framework 
for the development of cognitive KMSs. The proposed framework comprises of 
strategy, people, processes, learning, and technology that are designed to improve 
knowledge management and organizational memory.
