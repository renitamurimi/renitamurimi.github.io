A home is an emotional investment, a retreat, a safe space. The various elements of a home create an incomparable experience 
from other physical spaces. Alongside these elements, a home instills belonging and familiarity, creating a bond between the 
boundaries of a home and the individual. However, this bond may be destroyed through the intrusion of uninvited individuals, and this intrusion is fueled by the lack of security in smart home devices. Although they provide convenience, smart home devices are 
capable of being breached for various reasons, some being due to vulnerable sensors, faulty data protection mechanisms, and 
vulnerability to malware and flaws. In this paper, we analyze a smart home based on the theory of territoriality. By incorporating the theory of territoriality, our goal is to analyze how cyberattacks on smart devices can disrupt an individualâ€™s experience of a home.
