Robotic trolling instigated by instruments of the Russian Federation is widely believed to
have influenced the 2016 Presidential election in the United States. It is, however, extremely
difficult to measure or investigate actual political, let alone psychological and sociological,
effects caused by trolling and other similar online behavior. Consequently, we have
concentrated on quantifiable patterns of robotic troll behavior, both as a means of
identification, but also as a way of investigating the political logic behind that behavior.
