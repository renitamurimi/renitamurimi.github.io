Cities are microcosms representing a diversity of human experience. The complexity of urban systems arises from this diversity, where the services that cities ofer to their inhabitants have to be tailored for their unique requirements. This paper studies the complexity of urban environments in terms of the assimilation of its communities. We examine the urban assimilation complexity with respect to the foreignness between communities and formalize the level of complexity using information-theoretic measures. Our fndings contribute to a sociological perspective of the relationship between urban complex systems and the diversity of communities that make up urban systems.
