The spread of online misinformation should not be understood as a problem of false news, but rather of gossip run amok.
Misinformation must be addressed as part of the social dynamics of groups. In this paper, we reformulate the notion of
misinformation as part of a gossip economy. It highlights the logical similarities between misinformation and gossip, with
consequences for how we combat online misinformation.
