This case study follows the cybersecurity attack that impacted Lion, a large Australian beverage company with a portfolio of brands in beer, milk, wine, and other products. The ransomware attack, which impacted Lion in different phases, took place during a time of strained resources and increased restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper provides an overview of the warnings, events, and incidents leading up to the cyberattacks, and describes the impact to the company's operations. This case shows the parallel and connected challenges that the company faced in dealing with the ransomware and the pandemic's impact. While the cyber incidents had a significant impact on Lion's operations, the organization appeared to recover from it and resume operations. The case is suitable for students and practitioners interested in cybersecurity or information systems topics and presents the compounded impacts of cyberattacks and the COVID-19 pandemic on firms.
