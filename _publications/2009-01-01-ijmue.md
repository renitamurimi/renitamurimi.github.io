excerpt: 'Wireless sensor networks gather data about the environment. In that sense, they are paying attention to the environment in which they are deployed. This paper develops a foundation for understanding the association between the nature of attention in WSNs and their real-world applications.'

The large, rapidly growing field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) offers the ability to 
collect and process massive amounts of information from various environments. This 
distributed data gathering and computation with the help of tiny, power-limited devices 
enables their use in surveillance, target detection and various other monitoring applications. 
In this context, the role of a sensor network can be viewed as that of a system that pays 
attention to a phenomenon of interest. Thus, the current body of literature on WSNs falls into 
two major categories: developing networks that a. pay attention to the environment to detect 
the phenomenon under consideration and b. improving the quality of attention paid by WSNs 
to these phenomena. In this paper, we summarize a theoretical framework for the context of 
attention in WSNs. This paper is the first step to develop a foundation for understanding the 
association between the nature of attention in WSNs and their real-world applications.
