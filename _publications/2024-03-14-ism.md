This research presents a field survey of 328 individuals’ perceptions of their work from home (WFH) 
during Covid-19. This study challenges prior research that assumed most people were not suited 
for WFH and addresses a gap by looking at technology and support for WFH. The results led to 
a new model of technology resources and individuals’ satisfaction with the resources as they relate 
to WFH success.
