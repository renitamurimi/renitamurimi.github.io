Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are emerging as important networks, applicable in various fields. In this chapter a comprehensive survey of WBANs that are designed for applications in healthcare is presented. The survey consists of stand-alone sections focusing on important aspects of WBANs. Topics covered are: monitoring and sensing, power efficient protocols, physical layer, MAC protocols, routing, system architectures and security. The chapter concludes with a discussion of open research issues, their potential solutions and future trends.
