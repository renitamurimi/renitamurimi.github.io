Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are emerging as important networks, applicable in various 
fields. This paper surveys the WBANs that are designed for applications in healthcare. We present a 
comprehensive survey consisting of stand-alone sections focusing on important aspects of WBANs. We 
examine the following: monitoring and sensing, power efficient protocols, system architectures, routing 
and security. We conclude by discussing some open research issues, their potential solutions and future 
trends.
