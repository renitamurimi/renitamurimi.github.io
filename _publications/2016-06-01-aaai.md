The study of network sizes in digital social networks is a research question of significant interest. Here, we explore the 
phenomenon of trimming, which is the decrease in the size of one’s network, and analyze if the rules of social exchange theory – namely, status consistency and reciprocity- can affect trimming. To this end, we use a Hidden Markov Model to investigate the relationship between the frequency of interaction and one’s network size, in which we are able to control for the current size of one’s digital social network. We find that there are significant patterns in sharing tendencies in digital social networks. One is that users who do not share enough are the group that is most likely to be trimmed from a network. Another is that users prefer to have moderate sized networks, i.e. networks with 500 – 1000 friends and prefer friends with moderate sharing tendencies (sharing approximately once a week). We also find that one’s sharing preferences over time tend to align with moderate sharing.
