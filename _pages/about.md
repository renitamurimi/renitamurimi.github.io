I am an Associate Professor of Cybersecurity at the [University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/). I received a Phd and MS in Electrical Engineering from [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/), where my research was focused on studying the properties of wireless sensor networks. I was fortunate to be advised by [Sirin Tekinay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirin-tekinay-82149211/) and [Grace Guiling Wang](https://web.njit.edu/~gwang/), and I continue to be influenced by the ideas in network theory and graph theory that I learned during my time at NJIT. Previously, I received a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communications (with distinction) from [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html) in India. My interests in network science from a single elective called Mobile Networks that I took during my final year of my undergraduate education. 

Research interests
======

My current research interests are in the areas of cybersecurity, network science, blockchain, and computational social science. I am interested in interdisciplinary research, and I have collaborated and published with fellow researchers in diverse areas. I am the co-recipient of the 2011 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Grand Challenges Explorations Award for research into the navigation behavior of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. 

Teaching
======
At the University of Dallas's Satish and Yasmin Gupta College of Business, I teach a variety of courses in the NSA-designated [Master of Science in Cybersecurity](https://udallas.edu/academics/programs/cybersecurity/index.php) degree program. Some of these courses include penetration testing, software development, and cybersecurity strategy. I am the recipient of the [Haggerty Excellence in Teaching Award](https://udallas.edu/news/2022/01-28-22-Faculty-Excellence-Highlighted-at-Annual-King-Haggar-Awards.php) at the University of Dallas, where my teaching has been lauded for exemplary classroom instruction, exceptional advising, and mentoring.
